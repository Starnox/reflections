What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When i initialise a repository the .git folder is created which then allows me to create commits and have diffrent versions of the files through time

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It offers more control and flexibility over my project
